# Quora Upvote Count Revealer

## About

[Quora](https://www.quora.com) recently decided to hide the number of upvotes for
all unperusued answers. While the intent is ultimately noble (by allowing new,
unheralded responses to gain traction), this change can annoy Quorans who are
(lamentably) more interested in appreciating the tried-and-tested than discovering
hidden gems. This Chrome extension was designed specifically for that lazy ilk.

## Installation

* Obtain a local clone of the repository with
`git clone https://github.com/hieule22/quora-upvote-revealer.git`.

* Open the Chrome extension repository via `chrome://extensions`.

* Drag the folder containing the extension onto the repository page.

* Navigate to [quora.com](https://www.quora.com) and bask yourself in pseudo-omniscience.
